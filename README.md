# Stock_price
This repository contains a project where I used Selenium to scrape stock data for the FPT ticker from the CafeF website. I then used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to train and predict the closing price of the next trading day based on the closing price information of the previous n days.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore the capabilities of LSTM models in time series prediction, specifically for stock price forecasting. By using historical closing price data, the model attempts to predict future closing prices, which could provide valuable insights for investment strategies.
